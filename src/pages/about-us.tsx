            Open Source Community Africa (O.S.C.A) is for open source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates and experts within
            and across Africa with the sole aim of increasing the rate of credible contributions by African software
            developers, designers, writers and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects
            both locally and globally, changing the perception of Africans from just the billion users to the

            We are a diverse community of open source lovers, collaborating on different projects to make a difference
            across Africa.
            <br />
            <br />
            We currently achieve this through the following vehicles;
            <br />
            <br />
            OSCA Chapters, Open Source Festival and through featured open source projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our main goal is to create an atmosphere in which Africans not only use software and hardware but are also
            creators of these technologies.

            In due time, we hope technological skills would be at the grassroots of Africa.
            <br />
            <br />
            Take African developers from the billion users to the billion creators; We hope to do this with our monthly
            OSCA meetups across different chapters.
            <br />
            <br />
            We hope to work with numerous organizations that promote open source culture to reach their targeted
            audience and contributors. We will be creating the enabling environment that will allow thinkers and
            creators to develop open source technologies that will impact people. We are a diverse community of open
            source lovers, collaborating on different projects to make a difference across Africa.

            Currently we have smaller communities of people in a particular city called chapters; OSCA Lagos, OSCA
            Port-Harcourt, OSCA Imo and OSCA Lokoja. Each of this chapters have successfully hosted a physical meetup.
